## My process
I designed this challenge step by step. I added several commits if you would like to see.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This challenge is super educational for positioning,background image element etc.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child1">
  </div>
  <div class="child2">
    <img id="victor" src="images/victor.jpg" alt="victor">
  </div>
  <div class="child3">
    <p id="victors_p">Victor Crest</p>
 ```
 ```CSS
 .tlc
 {
   background-image:url("../images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),url("../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
   background-size: 70%,70%;
   background-repeat: no-repeat,no-repeat;
   background-position:top 170% left -70%, right -50% bottom 200%;
   text-align: center;
   height: 720px;
 }
```



### Continued development

I still need to learn a lot. Please contact me if you think i did something wrong or weak or mine is worse than yours.
